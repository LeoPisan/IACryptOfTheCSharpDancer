Practical work I have done for my bachelor's degree in IT. It is able to modelize a game (developed by a teacher for the occasion) under the form of a graph which it then explore and uses the results to guide the character in the game.

The goal was to enable the students to learn how a graph work (by implementing the representation of a game in that form), what are the most common algorithms used to explore them efficiently and how they work by implementing them.

*I did not invent anything with that*, all the credits goes to my teacher for that. I simply solved the exercises about **modelization and algorithms implementation** (which was a lot of fun).

You'll probably notice a lot of my commits and stuffs in my code are in french, I hope it won't prevent you from understanding what it does if that is of any interest to you.
